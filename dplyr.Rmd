Hi, My name is Kimberly Staudt. I am a data science student at Mercyhurst University.The purpose of this website is to give a brief tutorial on R, using the dplyer function and lahman baseball database.



## Filtering Columns and Rows
###Introduction

When utilizing dplyr, you can filter columns and rows by using select and filter. The lahman baseball database provides all of the data we will need for the following examples. First, load the database along with dplyr by selecting the "Install Packages" button under "Tools". Use the library function, as seen below, to load packages. 

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(dplyr)
```

<b>Example #1</b>

First, let us specify a year, such as 1927, for the NY Yankees and exam all home runs within that year.
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
Batting%>%
  select(playerID,yearID,teamID,HR)%>%
  filter(teamID=="NYA" & yearID==1927)
```

<b>Example #2</b>

Below, you will find Yankees who have hit 40 or more homeruns.
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
Batting%>%
  select(playerID,yearID,teamID,HR)%>%
  filter(teamID=="NYA" & HR>=40)
```


<b>Example #3</b>

Now, let us examine a scenario where each player hits more than 40 homeruns, but struck out 60 times or less.
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
 Batting%>%
    select(playerID,yearID,teamID,HR,SO)%>%
    filter(HR>40 & SO<60) 
```

<b>Example #4</b>

The table below shows all Philly players who hit more than 30 homeruns in the 1970's.
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
 Batting%>%
    select(playerID,yearID,teamID,HR)%>%
    filter(HR>30 & yearID>=1970 & yearID<=1979 & teamID=="PHI")
```

##Arrange
With arrange we can order our results by specifying the order in which they appear. 


<b>Example #5</b>

In this example, we can find every instance where a player has more than 50 homeruns, however the players with the most homeruns are at the top of the list. 
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
 Batting%>%
    select(playerID,yearID,teamID,HR)%>%
    filter(HR>50)%>%
    arrange(desc(HR))
```

<b>Example #6</b>

Next, we will list all instances of players who struck out less than 10 times,
but have to have at least 400 bats (AB).

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
 Batting%>%
    select(playerID,yearID,teamID,SO,AB)%>%
    filter(AB>=400 & SO<10 )%>% 
    arrange(SO)
```

##Aggregation
Aggregation is useful to sum or total the averages, as well as any maximums and minimums.


<b>Example #7</b>

Here, we add the total number of career homeruns for the player Babe Ruth
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
 Batting%>%
  filter(playerID=='ruthba01')%>%
  group_by(playerID)%>%
  summarize(career_HR=sum(HR))
```

<b>Example #8</b>

The example below uses aggregation to find the career  totals for all players with 600 homeruns or more, with the highest totals arranged at the top.
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
 Batting%>%
  group_by(playerID)%>%
  summarize(career_HR=sum(HR))%>%
  filter(career_HR>=600)%>%
  arrange(desc(career_HR))
```

<b>Example #9</b>

We can also look at the average homeruns of all players, but limit it to those with more than 30 homeruns.
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
 Batting%>%
  group_by(playerID)%>%
  summarize(HRAvg=mean(HR))%>%
  filter(HRAvg>30)%>%
  arrange(desc(HRAvg))
```

<b>Example #10</b>
For our last example, let's look at players who have hit more than 50 homeruns since the 1970's.
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
 Batting%>%
  filter(yearID>=1970)%>%
  group_by(playerID,yearID)%>%
  summarize(maxHR=mean(HR))%>%
  filter(maxHR>50)
```
